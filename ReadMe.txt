WikiMod v0.97 (for Xoops2)
==========================

WikiMod is a light-weight Wiki implementation with seamless
integration into Xoops. Inside of WikiMod, all users can easily
modify all pages and also create new ones _ad libitum_.


Installation
------------
* Copy this folder into Xoops' modules folder
* Install WikiMod through the Module Administration
* Allow the "Anonymous Users" group to access WikiMod


Usage
-----
* When you access WikiMod for the first time, you'll be asked
  to create the Wiki's homepage (usually named "WikiHome").
* Use WikiMod more or less as any other Wiki: create new pages
  by first setting a WikiLink on any page and then clicking on
  that link; edit any page by clicking on Edit at the upper right.

* As administrator, you can additionally see the history of each
  page and restore a page to a former state or fix a page's state
  (i.e. drop all older revisions).
* On the Preferences page, you can (dis)allow anonymous users to
  create new pages and modify existing ones.
* And don't forget to clean up the database from time to time:
  this removes all page revisions older than 2 months (except one).


Text Formatting Rules
---------------------
* A Wiki page consists mainly of plain text, with some added
  formatting markup. WikiMod recognizes the following markup:

= Headers go in between 'equal' signs =
<<Bold>> and {{italic}} text are marked with double brackets
* Lists start with an asterisk for each item
> Quoting is done as in email programs
  Lines starting with two spaces are printed in a monospaced font
---- on an otherwise empty line produces a horizontal bar
* An empty line marks the end of a paragraph ([[BR]] forces a line break)

* WikiLinks are written in CamelCase and automatically recognized
  (if the destination page doesn't exist, a (?) is added after the link)
* Email addresses are automatically converted to links, as well
* All other links are of the following form:
  [[URL]] or [[URL name of the link]]
* Images are inserted as follows: [[IMG URL optional alternative text]]

* Finally, there exist two special commands:
  <[PageIndex]> produces an alphabetical index of all Wiki pages
  <[RecentChanges]> lists the 10 most recently changed pages


Limitations
-----------
WikiMod doesn't offer the following features (so far):
* Access to page history and a restore option for all users
* More markup (tables, more headings, other list types, etc.)
* A separate "Comment page" feature
* InterWiki links
